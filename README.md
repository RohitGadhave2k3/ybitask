You are an expert Python developer and machine learning engineer. I want you to create a **simple machine learning project for predicting cardiac disease** using Python. Follow these instructions carefully:

✅ **Project Description:**
- Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person has heart disease based on health-related features.
- Use Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.

✅ **Project Structure:**
- Clear and clean code with comments explaining each step.
- Follow best practices in coding and machine learning.

✅ **Steps to include in the project:**
1. **Import necessary libraries** (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.)
2. **Load the dataset** (Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle or UCI repository, or generate mock data if needed).
3. **Explore and preprocess the data:**
   - Display basic info and summary statistics.
   - Check for missing values and handle them if necessary.
   - Perform data visualization (correlation heatmap, feature distributions).
   - Encode categorical variables if present.
   - Feature scaling (StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler).
4. **Split the dataset** into training and testing sets.
5. **Train multiple machine learning models** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN) for comparison.
6. **Evaluate models** using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
7. **Print and display evaluation metrics**.
8. **Provide a conclusion** on the best-performing model.

✅ **Optional but appreciated:**
- Add simple user input code to predict heart disease risk based on custom inputs.
- Use Streamlit or Flask for a basic web interface if possible.
- Ensure readability, modular functions, and documentation.
